                        Though Pune is famous for the Ganesh Festival, Indian festivals like Diwali, Navaratri,
                        Janmashtami, Dussera, Holi, Christmas, Id, Rakshabandhan, etc are also celebrated with the same
                        excitement in Pune with no religion or language bars. </p>

                <P><b>Month :</b>March</P>
                <p>Holi, the colour of festivals, is celebrated in Maharashtra to seek the blessings of God for fertile
                    land and bountiful harvests. People play with various dry or water-based colours and spend entire
                    day singing, dancing and savouring delicious gujhiyas and snacks. On the eve of Holi, a wooden log
                    is burnt to symbolize the disappearance of all evil.</p>
